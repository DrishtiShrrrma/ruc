You'll also implement the backwards versions of some basic functions: if we have tensors `output = func(input)`, then the backward function of `func` can calculate the grad of `input` as a function of the grad of `output`.\n",

        "This section goes into more detail on the backpropagation methodology. In order to find the `grad` of each tensor in a computational graph, we first have to perform a **topological sort** of the tensors in the graph, so that each time we try to calculate `tensor.grad`, we've already computed all the other gradients which are used in this calculation. We end this section by writing a `backprop` function, which works just like the `tensor.backward()` method you're already used to in PyTorch.\n",

        "\n",
        "In this section, we build your own equivalents of `torch.nn` features like `nn.Parameter`, `nn.Module`, and `nn.Linear`. We can then use these to build our own neural network to classify MINST data.\n",

        "> * Implement more forward and backward functions, including for indexing, summing, and matrix multiplication\n",

In this case, it would make sense to set `grad_out = [1]` for the first backward function call, since we're computing $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial L} = 1$.

For example, this means that in our first gradient calculation (where `g` is the output and `f` is the input) we'll use `grad_out = dL/dg = v`. You don't really need to worry about this, because most of the time (including in the exercise below) we'll just be using the default behaviour where `v` is a tensor of 1s - this is equivalent to `L = g.sum()`."

By default `v` is a tensor of 1s of the same shape as the tensor you're calling `backward` from, meaning we're just backpropagating on `L.sum()`. Here, the `end_grad` argument you pass to `backward` gives you the option to override this default behaviour, in other words if it's supplied you should use it as the first input to your backward function instead of a tensor of 1s.

This is because a broadcast operation effectively copies our tensor, giving it more gradient paths that we need to sum over. Similarly, the backwards operation for summing is broadcasting. We can intuitively see this as follows: if we have some value `L = L(x_summed)` where `x_summed` is the result of summing `x` over some number of dimensions, then editing `x_summed[i, j, ...] += delta` has the same downstream effect as editing any one of the `x` values which were summed over to get `x_summed[i, j, ...]`.

        "If we have the gradient of `L` wrt `x[index]`, what is the gradient of `L` wrt `x`? The answer is it'll be an array of zeros, filled in with the values of `dL/dx[index]` at the appropriate index positions. For example, if `x = [1, 2, 3]` and `L = x[0]`, then we trivially have `dL/dx[0] = 1`, and we can compute `dL/dx = [1, 0, 0]` in this way.\n",

        "- The index is a tuple of (array or Tensor) representing coordinates. Each array is 1D and of equal length. Some coordinates may be repeated. This is [Integer array indexing](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.indexing.html#integer-array-indexing).\n",

For example if we're training a classifier and we have tensors `logprobs.shape = (batch_size, n_classes)` and `targets.shape = (n_classes,)` then we index the correct logprobs using `logprobs[arange(batch_size), targets]` (note that the `arange` function has been given to you earlier, when we defined the `Tensor` class - it's a simple wrapper around `np.arange`)."

        "Important note - in yesterday's exercises it was important to use inplace operations, so we would actually modify the existing tensor data rather than creating new tensors, and this is also the case here. The inplace operation `+=` is supported, since under the hood this calls `__iadd__` which we've defined in our `Tensor` class (same for subtraction, the underlying method here is `__isub__`). Note that we did discuss earlier how inplace operations are very risky for backprop, this is generally true however here we're using it for parameter updates which aren't meant to be differentiated and which are performed just before zeroing all gradients - this makes it safe in this particular context."

Because backprop is annoying and fiddly and depends heavily on exactly how the implementation works (with too many edge cases to test all of them), you may have to resort to replacing your code with the reference solution until you find the source of the error - this is a bit frustrating, but we'd be lying if we said ML isn't without its share of slow debugging sessions!"
